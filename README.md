## Hey there 👋

I'm Armand — a Machine Learning engineer and data enthusiast from France.  
I love building things that are not only smart, but actually useful. 

### What drives me 🚀
- Turning messy data into something meaningful  
- Designing ML pipelines that *actually run in production*  
- Learning new ways to blend data science, software engineering, and automation  

### A bit beyond tech 🎣
When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me hiking, fishing by a lake, or just enjoying nature.
