## Hey there 👋

I'm Armand — a Machine Learning engineer and data enthusiast from France 🇫🇷.  
I love building things that are not only smart, but actually useful. 

### What I'm working on 🔭
Currently building [**Job Finder**](https://armandmasseaugit.github.io/portfolio/projects/job_finder) — a recommendation system that collects job offers, learns from user feedback, and sends a daily personalized briefing with the most relevant opportunities.  

### A bit beyond tech 🎣
When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me hiking, fishing by a lake, or just enjoying nature.
